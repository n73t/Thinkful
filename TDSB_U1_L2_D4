-- What's the most expensive listing? What else can you tell me about the listing?

select
	price,
	neighbourhood, 
	room_type,
	minimum_nights,
	number_of_reviews,
	availability_365
from 
	listings
order by price desc

------------------------------
-- What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?

-- Solution 1: I solve this by counting the number of listings on the assumption that this reflects popularity
select
	neighbourhood,
	count(id) numberListings
from
	listings
group by neighbourhood
order by numberListings desc
limit 5

-- Solution 2: use number of reviews since 2016 for each listing in a neighbourhood to get popularity

with 
	listing_reviews
as(
	select
		listing_id,
		(case when strftime('%Y', date(date)) >= '2016' then 'keep' else 'drop' end) keep,
		count(*) numberReviews
	from
		reviews
	where 
		keep = 'keep'
	group by listing_id
)

select
	listings.neighbourhood,
	sum(listing_reviews.numberReviews) popularity
from	
	listings
join
	listing_reviews
on
	listings.id = listing_reviews.listing_id
group by listings.neighbourhood
order by popularity desc
limit 5

-- What is the busiest time to go to your city?

-- use the calendar file 
-- proxy busyness by scarcity of postings 
-- I interpret busy to refer to the difficulty of finding an apartment
-- one could also make other argument: busy refers to when there are more apartments posted.
select
	strftime('%m', date(date)) mm,
	count(*) postings
from 
	calendar
where
	available = 't'
group by 
	mm	
order by postings
